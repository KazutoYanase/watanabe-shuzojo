                <p>We hope that this shochu, which it is only possible for us to produce here in this location, will be enjoyed by as many people as possible.  However, rather than producing universally popular shochu, we would prefer to produce shochu that only 1 person out of 10,000 really believes is good. Ordinary things are done in an ordinary manner and we encourage a family business that progresses step by step along with the family and the workers.</p>
                <p>Around 100 years ago, the founder, Sugaichi, had a dream. He crossed the Pacific to the US to learn the knowledge and skills that he required to return Japan and set up in business. And currently, we are carrying on the dreams of the founder having renewed our enthusiasm and it is our turn to cross the ocean in order to communicate the Japanese distillation culture for honkaku shochu.</p>
